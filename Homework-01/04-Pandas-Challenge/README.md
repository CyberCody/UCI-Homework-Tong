PYMOLI ANALYSIS

1.) Reviewing the gender demographics data frame one can see that about 84% if the users are male. This as a marketing tool could be used to market to more males than female


2.) Reviewing the age demographics data frame about 45% of the users are between the age of 20-24. Combining the knowledge we have gained from the gender demo and age demo Pymoli can better target current users and also attract new users based on the data.


3.) This leads me to the next data frames which are the purchasing analysis by age, top spenders, and most popular items with these in mind Pymoli can target their internal market and gear ads to their niche accordingly based on age group, top selling item in that age group, and even market it to their top spending users.


Overall a lot more lucrative information can be pulled from even just the data frames created in this homework assignment. I think overall its a good overlook at how this Pymoli game can scale and narrow down their niche market.
