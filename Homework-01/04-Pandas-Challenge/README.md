PYMOLI ANALYSIS

1.) Reviewing the gender demographics data frame one can see that about 84% if the users are male. This as a marketing tool could be used to market to more males than females considering the demographic numbers.
2.) Reviewing the age demographics data frame about 45% of the users are between the age of 20-24. Combining the knowledge we have gained from the gender demo and age demo this give us a pin point market in which this company can direct ads to either gain new users OR to direct purchasing adds
3.) This leads me to the next data frames which are the purchasing analysis by age, top spenders, and most popular items with these in mind Pymoli can target their internal market by pushing more 'Final Critic' ads to users since this is their most bought item and not only that, pushing more of those adds to top spenders and also the age group of 20-24.

Overall a lot more lucrative information can be pulled from even just the data frames created in this homework assignment. I think overall its a good overlook at how this Pymoli game can scale by narrowing down their niche market.
