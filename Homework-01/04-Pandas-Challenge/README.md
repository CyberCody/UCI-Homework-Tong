## Fantasy: Heroes of Pymoli

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, I've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. I have been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like me to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

Final report includes each of the following:

### Player Count

* Total Number of Players

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)

* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics

* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

* The below each broken by gender
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

  * Purchase Count

### PYMOLI ANALYSIS
=======
1. Reviewing the gender demographics data frame one can see that about 84% if the users are male. This as a marketing tool could be used to market to more males than female


2. Reviewing the age demographics data frame about 45% of the users are between the age of 20-24. Combining the knowledge we have gained from the gender demo and age demo Pymoli can better target current users and also attract new users based on the data.


3. This leads me to the next data frames which are the purchasing analysis by age, top spenders, and most popular items with these in mind Pymoli can target their internal market and gear ads to their niche accordingly based on age group, top selling item in that age group, and even market it to their top spending users.


* Overall a lot more lucrative information can be pulled from even just the data frames created in this challenge. I think overall its a good overlook at how this Pymoli game can scale and narrow down their niche market.
